0	76623	Buy ski wax and a waxing table, or at least somewhere to set your skies upside down where you don't care if you get hot wax on it. Make sure that your wax is the right kind for your skies and skiing techniques. Do some research. Do you need racing wax, mogul skiing wax, etc. You will need a waxing iron. You will want to have a lighter. Once your skies are upside down, Take the lighter and the wax and light the wax from the bottom furthest away from your hand. Make sure that the wax is over your ski and light away. Drop hot wax evenly over your skies. Just a few drops to start will do. Before the wax dries, take the iron and smooth the wax in a straight line over your skies. repeat this until you have a thin, but covered layer of wax over your entire ski. Try to make sure that there are no bumps or divots in your wax as it will make skiing slower and more uneven.	1

They are named numerically, f 1.0 to f 32, but can be a wider range. The size of the circle for f 1.0 is larger than f 32, so it lets a lot more light into the camera. The camera compensates by making the shutter time shorter at f 1.0 than it would have to at f 32. A second effect of the aperture is depth of field. Because the circle is larger at f 1.0, light from every distance in the frame makes it through to the image, therefore the image has a smaller depth of field - area that is in accurate focus. This may appear as softening or blurring of the image outside the main are of focus. F 32 is a much smaller circle, so a very reduced amount of light makes it through the circle and the shutter time is generally increased to allow enough light into the camera to form the image. The smaller circle also means that the light contains less random rays, so the image is more accurate and precise over a large set of distance in the image, less blurred and more detailed. You can use the aperture to remove distractions, so if a person is standing in front of a group or object, then the f 1.0 will allow you to make the person the centre of the image and make surroundings softer, both in front and behind them. Similarly, using f 32 for landscapes means your more likely to get a detailed image for all the distances in the image, foreground, mid-ground and far distance.	1

5	37745	Tips -Be kind to your pup as they respond better to positive reinforcement than they do to yelling and shouting. -Give your pup a lot of praise for good behavior. This way they will learn that doing this certain good thing gets them either food, love, or attention. -Listen to them. Make sure you are understanding their needs and wants. For instance, a whine can mean different things. It can mean 'I'm hungry', 'I want to go to bed', 'I need the bathroom', as well as many other things. -Don't change commands. They'll get confused! If you're telling them to lie down and you keep changing the command, they'll never remember it!  Peeing and Pooping To stop them from peeing and pooping in the house, take your dog out frequently. When they pee/poo outside, give them a lot of praise and tell them what a good dog they are. Choose one place and stick with it. Also, don't be mad at accidents!! They call them that for a reason...  Biting/Mouthing It hurts a little, I know. Your dog thinks your its new pack, which is good, but dogs are generally rougher when it's their own species than when they know it isn't. Remember, those teeth could probably chew through bone if they wanted to! When a real dog-gy pack member is being chewed on too hard, i.e. the pup's mother, it lets out a high-pitched yelp. They may not be in pain but they know it's too hard. Say 'Ow!' in a very high-pitched tone and look hurt. They should get the message.  Good Luck with your dog, and have fun!!! :)	1

8	825656	Nutrition is one of the biggest factors in bodybuilding. You can lift 7 days a week but if your nutrition is poor, you will not see rapid and mass gains in muscle size and strength. For mass muscle gain, you need to put on calories with your regular lifting. To workout the daily calories you need for mass muscle gain, simply times your body weight in pounds by 20. Also, to workout how many grams of protein you need daily, if you are aiming for mass muscle, times 0.8 by your body weight in pounds. (you should consume 0.8g of protein per pound of bodyweight.) Protein supplements such as whey powders are good and benefit widely if you think you are not getting you daily amount of protein(If you are completely getting your full protein amount from just the food you eat then protein supplements are not necessarily required.) Your daily protein intake should be around 20-35% of your calories. Protein supplements are most effective within 30 minutes after a workout, so that the muscles can rapidly recover and therefore grow. Other times can include around an hour before you workout, this stimulates protein synthesis, and anytime between meals as a snack. It is advised you should take no more than 3 servings of protein supplement within a day, otherwise you are wasting your protein supplement because you are ingesting excess protein. However, carbs are also very important, and should consist of around 60% of your daily calorie intake. Carbohydrates are vital for maintaining muscle glycogen stores which elicit maximum training energy. they also stimulate insulin release, which is a powerful agent for tissue growth. Healthy fats are also important. They are an essential component of a hardcore mass gain plan. Healthy fats include nuts, olive oil, avocados, butter and eggs, which support the production of testosterone. Eat the majority of your carbs on workout days, especially post-workout. It is an excellent way to promote lean mass gains and minimise unwanted fat.	1
