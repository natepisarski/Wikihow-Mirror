I just wanted to touch base in case you were wondering what happens next :) All new articles go through a quality review process to ensure they follow our community guidelines. If your article meets those guidelines, you'll get a note letting you know that it's been promoted.

You might get a kick out of flipping through the [[Special:EditFinder/Topic|Topic Greenhouse]] to find articles in your area of expertise so you can add your knowledge there, too!",
